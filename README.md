# connectivity

This plugin allows Flutter apps to discover network connectivity and configure
themselves accordingly. It can distinguish between cellular vs WiFi connection.
This plugin works for iOS and Android.

> Note that on Android, this does not guarantee connection to Internet. For instance,
the app might have wifi access but it might be a VPN or a hotel WiFi with no access.
